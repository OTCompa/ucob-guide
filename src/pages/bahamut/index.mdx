## Overview
Bahamut Prime is a long, fixed phase consisting of short damage and tankbuster downtimes interrupted by "Trio" mechanics where the boss is untargetable. 
These trios are named as such as the three bosses, Bahamut, Nael and Twin all make an appearance in each mechanic.

Alongside surviving the phase to the end of its mechanics, there is a hidden fail-state that will come into play if the boss is not brought
down to 59.9% HP by the time he disappears for Grand Octet. In the case you do not meet this DPS check you will not be punished immediately, during the following phase (Adds)
you won't notice anything, but in the final phase the boss will have a damage up buff, causing him to deal 500% damage in his attacks, effectively rendering the phase unclearable for a standard group.[^1]

As the phase is significant in length, generally speaking people will progress the phase trio by trio, rather than the phase as a whole, as this helps build consistency and find groups of players at a similar point within the phase.
As such, we have split the guide into pages for each of the trios and this general page for the remaining in-between parts.

## Tank Busters
There are two different types of Tankbuster that Bahamut does during the phase while targetable, Flare Breaths and Flattens.

### Flare Breath
Each Flare Breath is an untelegraphed conal AOE tankbuster that should be pointed away from the party.
It either comes in single alongside a Flatten, or as triple Flare Breath, hitting 3 times in quick succession.

### Flatten
A heavy hitting, casted tankbuster on the main aggro, unlike Twin and Nael this tankbuster does not apply any damage resistence down debuffs meaning that there's no need for a tank swap.

[^1]: While unclearable in pretty much any standard case, the 500% damage up buff is not technically unclearable:
