<Notification title="NA strat tl;dr">
    Tank bosses between 1 and 3 (NE-ish)  
    Stacks during quotes are always taken in the center of the arena (4 marker)  
    Spreads in rough-QM spots[^1]  
</Notification>

## Overview
[Overall Raidplan](https://raidplan.io/plan/AMEhnLbUmlTb7ij3)  
Adds phase consists of 2 similar mechanic loops where both Nael and Twintania are targetable at the same time.  
Both bosses should be tanked on top of each other allowing for passive cleave.  
There is a passively filled duty gauge indicating the timer for Teraflare (enrage).
Nothing the player does affects the rate of which this duty gauge fills except defeating
both Twintania and Nael.

## Timeline Breakdown
### First half

<Card title="Mechanic Order">
    - Plummet + Bahamut's Claw
    - Liquid Hells
    - Generate
    - Twister
    - Triple quotes
    - Twister
    - Megaflare
    - Death Sentence + Ravensbeak
</Card>

#### Plummet + Bahamut's Claw
Same mini-busters in Twintania and Nael phases
The Twin tank should attempt to face the Plummet away from other players. Likewise, other players 
including the Nael tank should also make an effort to not be in the way of the Plummet.
#### Liquid Hells
Same as the baited Liquid Hells in Twintania phase
Generally, the physical ranged player will bait the Liquid Hells during this phase
#### Generate + Twister Combo
Hatch + Twister slightly similar to what happens in Twintania phase
Hatches during this phase will always spawn in sets of 3 and will only target DPS.  
Generally, the melee DPS and physical ranged have assigned Neurolinks (2 Neurolinks close to the bosses and far Neurolink
respectively) where they will always intercept the Hatch. 
<Notification title="Resolve Order">
    Due to the difference in distance between Twintania and each of the Neurolinks, the Twister
    may happen before or after the Hatch is close enough to be intercepted.  
    The following works as a general rule:  
    For the players using the **close** Neurolinks, they will resolve **Hatch first then Twister**.  
    For the player using the **far** Neurolink, they will resolve **Twister first then Hatch**.
</Notification>
#### Triple quotes 
Nael will perform a set of 3 mechanics back-to-back based on her RP text. There will be 4 possible combinations:
- `From hallowed moon I bare iron, in my descent to wield!` (In > Out > Spread)
- `From hallowed moon I descend, upon burning earth to tread!` (In > Spread > Stack)
- `Unbending iron, descend with fiery edge!` (Out > Spread > Stack)
- `Unbending iron, take fire and descend!` (Out > Stack > Spread)
  
Like Nael phase, reading the quotes quickly can be done by searching for keywords in the quote:
- Moon = In
- Iron = Out
- Descend = Spread
- Burning/Fire = Stack
<NASpecific>
    Stacks during the triple quotes should __always__ be taken in the center of the arena (4 marker).
</NASpecific>

### Second half

<Card title="Mechanic Order">
    - Plummet + Bahamut's Claw
    - Liquid Hells
    - Generate + Twister
    - Triple quotes
    - Twister
    - Death Sentence + Ravensbeak
    - Megaflare
    - Teraflare (enrage)
</Card>

<br/>

This half is mostly a repeat of the previous half except the order of the 
Death Sentence + Ravensbeak combo is swapped with the Megaflare.  
<Notification title="Second Half Triple Quotes">
If the first triple quote begins with a Lunar Dynamo (in), this triple quote will __always__ 
be one of the two quotes that start with an Iron Chariot (out) and vice versa.
